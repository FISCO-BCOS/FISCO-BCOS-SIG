# Network and Consensus Special Interest Group

The Network and Consensus Special Interest Group(NC-SIG) is mainly responsible for the design and development of the FISCO BCOS 3.0 network and consensus components, as follows:

- **Organization-oriented hierarchical network architecture design and development**:Basing from the actual needs of the institutional alliance blockchain, the second-layer network is introduced on the basis of the institutional node network. Design access, governance, and distribution mechanisms based on the second-tier network to achieve a safe, efficient, stable, and scalable hierarchical network architecture

- **Design and development of basic components of blockchain network**: The next generation of FISCO BCOS will reorganize and split the existing blockchain functional modules, develop towards more modularity and plug-in, and provide reusable micro-components or micro-services. NC-SIG will further study the blockchain network Architecture and protocol design to create reusable and pluggable network infrastructure components

- **Organization-oriented consensus algorithm design**: Starting from the actual scenario of the institutional alliance blockchain, comprehensively considering the differences in security requirements within and between institutions, abstract consensus component interfaces, reshape the current consensus algorithm, realize flexible, universal, safe and scalable consensus components, and continue to optimize consensus Algorithm performance, throughput and scalability

## Group Collaboration Process

- **[Workflow](./workflow.md)**
- **features management && bug tracking**: `github projects` + `issues`
- **Proposal Document**: The new proposal mentioned [here](./proposals), please refer to [here](./proposals/bip_template.md) for the proposal template
- **Notice release**: WeChat group + `nc_sig_public@groups.163.com`
- **Development branch**: Small features can be directly referred to the `dev` branch, and large features can be developed separately by pulling feature branches
- **[Git usage specification](../share/git.md)**

## Group Meetings

- Regular group meeting: once every two weeks
